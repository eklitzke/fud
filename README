FUD is a python debugger. The goal is to make a module that can create a new
Python thread that hooks into Python's tracing system to provide debugging
capabilities. The debugger is accessed via a Chrome extension that pops up a new
window and gives you a console and real time CPU, memory, etc. statistics.

My goal is that FUD will make it possible to debug Python processes embedded in
server runtimes (e.g. inside of an HTTP server, or some other Python
daemon). The conventional means of doing this, by running the server in
foreground mode (e.g. running `apache -X -k start`), is slow, difficult to use,
and inflexible.

It doesn't work yet, at all. So don't expect it to.
